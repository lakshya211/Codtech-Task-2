**Housing Price Prediction Project**=
This project is focused on predicting housing prices based on a dataset of housing features using regression techniques. It includes data exploration, preprocessing, and implementing machine learning models in Python.

**Files in the Repository**-
**housing.csv**-
A dataset containing housing features and corresponding prices. This file is used as the input data for the project.
**Regression.ipynb**-
A Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the entire pipeline:
Data exploration and visualization,
Data preprocessing and feature engineering,
Implementation of regression models,
Model evaluation and performance metrics,
